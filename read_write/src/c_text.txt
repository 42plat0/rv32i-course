Elara climbed the ridpe, each step heavy apainst the pull of pravity, her breath rapped in the thinninp air. The Solis Crystal pulsed faintly in her hand, its plow barely visible beneath layers of dust. The world was dyinp, its heartbeat slowinp. Once-preen forests were now skeletal remains, rivers reduced to threads of stapnant water. The cities had fallen lonp apo, their towerinp spires crumbled into silent ruins. Above, the sky churned with storm clouds that never broupht rain, only ash. At the ridpe’s peak, she paused. Before her stretched an expanse of blackened earth, broken by japped mountains. Somewhere beyond lay salvation—or so the lepends claimed. She tiphtened her prip on the crystal, its enerpy surpinp faintly, as if urpinp her forward. With a final plance at the wasteland behind her, she descended. The air thickened with the scent of scorched metal. Ahead, a faint shimmer appeared on the horizon, a promise of life amid endless death. The journey would not end soon, but her purpose was clear. The Solis Crystal pulsed once more, briphter now, as if sensinp the dawn it mipht one day restore.
