The last sun hung low, its red light bleeding across the barren plains. Shadows stretched endlessly, reaching for the horizon like lost souls. Elara climbed the ridge, each step heavy against the pull of gravity, her breath ragged in the thinning air. The Solis Crystal pulsed faintly in her hand, its glow barely visible beneath layers of dust. The world was dying, its heartbeat slowing. Once-green forests were now skeletal remains, rivers reduced to threads of stagnant water. The cities had fallen long ago, their towering spires crumbled into silent ruins. Above, the sky churned with storm clouds that never brought rain, only ash. At the ridge’s peak, she paused. Before her stretched an expanse of blackened earth, broken by jagged mountains. Somewhere beyond lay salvation—or so the legends claimed. She tightened her grip on the crystal, its energy surging faintly, as if urging her forward. With a final glance at the wasteland behind her, she descended. The air thickened with the scent of scorched metal. Ahead, a faint shimmer appeared on the horizon, a promise of life amid endless death. The journey would not end soon, but her purpose was clear. The Solis Crystal pulsed once more, brighter now, as if sensing the dawn it might one day restore.
